- **2)**
The work of `reachable` is O(n+m)

- **4)**
If a graph is connected, the worst case number of times `reachable` would need to be called is n because that is the total number of nodes in the graph (in the worst case scenario, all the nodes would be visited).

- **5)**
The work of `connected` is also O(n+m)

- **7)**
If we switched to an adjacency matrix, the work would change to be O(n^2). Therefore, it would increase, which makes sense since it's a matrix and not a list.
